Currently this is where I am working on the two-step band
reduction algorithm of https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Bischof/publication/2468485_Parallel_Tridiagonalization_through_Two-Step_Band_Reduction/links/0deec51c057776064f000000/Parallel-Tridiagonalization-through-Two-Step-Band-Reduction.pdf.
